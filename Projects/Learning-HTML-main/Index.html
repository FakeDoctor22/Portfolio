    <h1>Interneting is Easy!</h1>
    <p>First, we need to learn some basic HTML</p>
    <h2>Headings</h2>
    <p>Headings define the outline of your site. Ther are six levels of<br>
    headings</p>

    <h2>Lists</h2>
    <p>this is how you make an unordered list:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Add a "ul" element (it stands for unordered list)</li>
        <li>Add each item in its own "li" element</li>
        <li>they don't need to be in any particular order</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This is what an ordered list looks like</p>
    <ol>
        <li>notice the new "ol" elements</li>
        <li>But, the list item elements are the same</li>
        <li>also note how the numbers increment on their own</li>
        <li>You should be noticing things in this precise order, because this is an ordered list</li>
    </ol>

    <H2>Inline Elements</H2>
        <p><em>Sometimes,</em>you need to draw attention to a particular word or phrase.</p> 
        <p>Other time, you need to <strong>strongly</strong> emphasize the importance of a word or phrase</p>
    
        <P><em><strong>And sometimes you need to shout!</strong></em></P>
    
    <H2>Empty Elements</H2>
    
    <p>Thanks for reading! Interneting should be getting easier now.</p>

    <p>Regards,<br>
